Where to find the main code:

server.js contains the back-end code, and the public/ folder contains the front-end code, including home.js.
Detailed comments (both at the top, and throughout the code) are in server.js and home.js, 
as well as in convert.py for how we instantiated the database with stock information from Yahoo.

Our test cases are in the tests/ folder. Our calculations for those were handed into the TAs, and our code successfully passed all those tests. 
The given CSVs, from Piazza, are in the scripts/ folder.

Our stocks.db database has not been included, to save space.

All of the stock CSV files were loaded in an initial csv/ folder, using a correct version of the CURL command from Piazza. 
Those CSV files were removed after being loaded into SQLite, to save space.

To install the node modules used in the project, you would use the command 'npm install' once installing Node.js on your computer. 
This pulls the necessary module names from our package.json file.
